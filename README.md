### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don’t already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for one.

### Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-html-project`). You can also add a description if you want.
4. Choose the repository to be either public or private (public is recommended for GitHub Pages).
5. Initialize the repository with a README file (optional).
6. Click on "Create repository."

### Step 3: Upload Your HTML Files
1. Go to your newly created repository.
2. Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files."
3. Drag and drop your HTML files (and any other assets like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select them.
4. Once your files are uploaded, scroll down and click on "Commit changes."

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
2. Scroll down to the "Pages" section (you may need to click on "Code and automation" to find it).
3. Under "Source," select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`) and the folder (usually `/ (root)`).
4. Click "Save."

### Step 5: Access Your Hosted Site
After a few moments, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted. It will typically be in the format:
```
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```
For example, if your GitHub username is `johnDoe` and your repository is named `my-html-project`, your site would be accessible at:
```
https://johnDoe.github.io/my-html-project/
```

### Step 6: Update Your Project
Whenever you want to update your project:
1. Make changes to your files locally.
2. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
3. Your GitHub Pages site will automatically update with the latest changes.

### Additional Tips
- **Custom Domain**: If you want to use a custom domain, you can set that up in the GitHub Pages settings.
- **Index File**: Ensure you have an `index.html` file in your repository, as this is the default file that GitHub Pages will serve.
- **Check for Errors**: If your site doesn’t appear, check the repository settings and ensure that the correct branch and folder are selected for GitHub Pages.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully host your HTML project on GitHub Pages!
