Hosting an HTML project on GitHub is a straightforward process, thanks to GitHub Pages. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get your project online:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don’t already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for one.

### Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-html-project`). You can also add a description.
4. Choose the repository to be either public or private.
5. Check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README" if you want to add a README file.
6. Click on "Create repository."

### Step 3: Upload Your HTML Files
1. Go to your newly created repository.
2. Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files."
3. Drag and drop your HTML files (and any associated CSS, JavaScript, or image files) into the upload area, or click "choose your files" to select them from your computer.
4. Once your files are uploaded, scroll down and click on "Commit changes."

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, click on the "Settings" tab.
2. Scroll down to the "Pages" section on the left sidebar.
3. Under "Source," select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`) and the folder (usually `/ (root)`).
4. Click "Save."
5. After a few moments, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted (e.g., `https://username.github.io/my-html-project/`).

### Step 5: Access Your Hosted Site
- Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by GitHub Pages. Your HTML project should now be live!

### Additional Tips
- **Custom Domain**: If you want to use a custom domain, you can set that up in the same "Pages" section.
- **Updating Your Site**: To update your site, simply make changes to your files locally and push them to the GitHub repository. The changes will be reflected on your GitHub Pages site shortly after.
- **Index File**: Ensure you have an `index.html` file in your repository, as this is the default file that GitHub Pages looks for when loading your site.

### Conclusion
That's it! You have successfully hosted your HTML project on GitHub Pages. If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!
